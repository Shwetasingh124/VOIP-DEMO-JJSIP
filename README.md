# VOIP-DEMO-JSSIP

This project demonstrates the integration of **VoIP (Voice over IP)** using **JsSIP** and **FreeSWITCH** to enable real-time audio and video calling functionalities. It showcases the ability to manage incoming and outgoing SIP-to-SIP calls, providing a seamless communication experience.

## Features:
- **Audio and Video Calls**: Supports high-quality audio and video calling through SIP protocol.
- **SIP-to-SIP Communication**: Enables SIP-based call initiation and reception between users.
- **FreeSWITCH Integration**: Utilizes FreeSWITCH as the backend to manage call routing and signaling.
- **VMware Environment**: Configured to work within a VMware virtual machine for testing and development.
- **Real-time Communication**: Demonstrates how to use WebRTC and SIP for real-time communications.

## Technologies Used:
- **JsSIP**: JavaScript library to implement SIP protocol in web applications.
- **FreeSWITCH**: Open-source communication platform for routing and signaling.
- **WebRTC**: For real-time media (audio & video) streaming.
- **VMware**: Virtualization environment for running the server setup.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Shwetasingh124/VOIP-DEMO-JSSIP.git`
2. Set up **FreeSWITCH** on your VMware environment.
3. Install **JsSIP** dependencies.
4. Run the application and test **SIP-to-SIP** audio and video calls.

## Use Cases:
- Build custom VoIP applications.
- Integrate real-time communication features into web applications.
- Develop and test SIP-based calling solutions.
